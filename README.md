# Travail de mercredi ---- Wednesday homework
This is the work about a popup that is displayed automatically after the user being for 5 seconds on the web page of Better Mother Fucking Website.

The Better Mother Fucking Website is a concept created by co authors, that had the practical ambition of initiating novice programmers to concepts of page layout in HTML. Some of the skills required to do the homework are the layout of titles, the layout of paragraphs, and the general layout of a page surface in a navigator.
For this purpose, the content of the text is given and the model is furnished via a weblink.
I was asked to recreate the content. 

After 5 seconds, a popup appears to ask you if you want to go on a videos website. 
If you answer yes, you watch a video. 
Else, you stay on the current page.
