the work about a popup that is displayed automatically after being 5 seconds on the web page of BetterMotherFucking Website

The Better Mother Fuckingn Website is a concept created by co authors, that had the practical ambition of initiating novice programmers to concepts of page layout in HTML. Some of the skills required are the layout of titles, the layout of paragraphs and the general layout of a page surface in a navigator.
For this purpose, the content of the textif given and the model is furnished via a weblink and I was asked to recreate the content.
